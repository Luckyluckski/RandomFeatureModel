# RandomFeatureModel
I implement the Random Feature Model (as discussed in https://proceedings.mlr.press/v107/ma20a.html or in https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15849) using tensorflow.
The purpose is not to optimize the learning performance but to reproduce the double descent phenomenon and gain insight about the risk curve.
